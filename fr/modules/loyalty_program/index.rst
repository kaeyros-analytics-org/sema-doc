    * Set a required number of purchases for a reward.
    * Track customer purchases via Qr Code scanning.
    * Notify customers of their progress towards earning rewards.
* Use Case:
    * After each purchase, a customer scans a Qr Code using WhatsApp or Telegram. Once they reach the required number of purchases, they receive a reward, such as a discount or a free product.
