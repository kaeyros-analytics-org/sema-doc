## Sema and its features {-}

**1. Chatbot:**

A chatbot is a service that enables a customer and a company to chat on WhatsApp via a private channel. In the chat, the company is represented by a robot that automatically responds to the customer's needs, without the customer realizing that they are talking to a robot. The discussion usually focuses on the customer's order, but a company manager can also take part to guide the customer.

**2. Bulk Message:**

The bulk message can be advertised on a large scale to thousands of people. The advertisement can relate to an upcoming event, a discount on product prices, a gift given after a purchase with achieved points, a new product arrival, etc. After the advertising campaign with the bulk message, you receive feedback from customers on whether they liked it or not. If the customer replies to the publication, the bulk message automatically triggers a discussion between the customer and the company's chatbot.

**3. Loyalty Program:**

Loyalty Program helps build customer loyalty through rewards. Loyalty Program counts the number of times a customer has purchased your products and rewards them based on this number and the products they have purchased. After a purchase, the customer scans a QR code. This scan saves the number of times the customer has made purchases, and rewards the customer as soon as he or she has reached the number of purchases required for the reward.

**4. Tombola Promotion:**

The tombola helps build customer loyalty through a game of chance. Customers know that for every purchase they make, they have the chance to win another product by taking part in a raffle. After making a purchase, the customer scans a QR code that draws a random number from among the products up for grabs. The customer may win nothing and be encouraged to buy another product to try a second time.

**5. Analysis Dashboard:**

The Analysis Dashboard is an interface that lets you visualize your business statistics and see whether you're progressing or regressing. Thanks to the Analysis Dashboard, you'll know which service to improve and how to improve it.


**6. Chatbot Builder:**

The Chatbot Builder is a free form that allows you to build a questionnaire and answer proposals if they exist. This questionnaire is executed by the chatbot when a customer sends a message to the company.

**7. Bulk Message Builder:**

The Bulk Message Builder is a form for editing bulk messages. This form is used to record the advertising image and the text to be read by customers.

**8. Loyalty Program Builder:**

The Loyalty Program Builder is a form for editing loyalty programs. A program contains the products to be won and the number of points per product that the customer must accumulate to win.

**9. Tombola Builder:**

The Tombola Builder is a form for editing tombola programs. A tombola contains the products that can be won and any empty products that show the customer that he hasn't won.
