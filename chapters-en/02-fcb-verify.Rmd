# Facebook Business Verification 


In this article we explain how to verify your WhatsApp Business account to enable you to send WhatsApp campaigns to a large number of customers.


## Before you start 



* Link your WhatsApp Business account to Sema. To find out more, see our [dedicated article]().
* You must be an administrator of the [WhatsApp Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) account to verify your business.
* Scan a professional document indicating the legal name of your business to verify it. If your business is not listed in the **Select Your Businesses** step of the verification process, you will also need to scan business documents supporting your business address and/or phone number. To learn more, check out the [official Facebook documentation](https://business.facebook.com/business/help/159334372093366?__tn__=%2BR).
